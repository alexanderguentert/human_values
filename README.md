Relationship between Human Values an Religiousness


Recreating some of the results from my masters thesis in python (originally done in SPSS).
Based on the Theory of Basic Human Values by Schwartz (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Basic_Human_Values).

In relation to religiousness the theory predicts that correlations with the values follow a certain pattern that can be displayed as sinusoid curve. Strongest positive relationsship is expected with the value "Tradition", stronged negative relationship is expected with the value "Hedonism".

A part of the Thesis was to test if these hypothesis can be confirmed for certain groups in German population (Protestants, Catholics, Atheists, East and West).
